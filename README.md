2. **Leave Request Management**:
   - Employees can submit leave requests with start and end dates and reasons.
   - Admin can review and update the status of leave requests (Pending, Approved, Rejected).

3. **Payroll Management**:
   - Calculate net salary based on bonuses and deductions.
   - Display payroll information for each employee.
